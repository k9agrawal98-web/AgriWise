# Test inventory

This file contains historical suite/browser records and the latest full test
run recorded by the 2026-10-15 repository audit. Results are tied to their
dates/commands; do not interpret an older run as current.

## Execution environment

Python 3.12.4, Flask 3.0.3, scikit-learn 1.5.1, pandas 2.2.2, numpy 2.0.2,
pytest 8.3.2. Platform: Windows, PowerShell. Many test-created application
instances use disposable SQLite databases under `tmp_path`. However,
importing `app.py` constructs its module-level Flask app and invokes
`create_app()`, which initializes the configured default database. In the
2026-10-15 audit environment that path was the repository's `database.db`.
The audit did not inspect its contents; whether initialization/migrations
changed existing data or schema cannot be established. Do not claim that the
full suite never accesses the configured database.

## 1. Consolidated result

| Suite | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Full automated suite (historical, 2026-10-14) | `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q --no-header -p no:cacheprovider` | **145 passed, 1 warning, 0 failed** in 80.67s |
| Security suite (historical targeted run) | `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_security.py -q --no-header -p no:cacheprovider` | **11 passed** in ~15s |
| Browser automation (historical) | `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\browser_check.py` | See "Browser automation" below; does not verify current homepage. |
| Full automated suite (latest, 2026-10-15) | `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q --no-header -p no:cacheprovider` | **164 passed, 1 warning, 0 failed**. See side-effect disclosure above and [current audit](research_audit/TESTING_AUDIT.md). |

The historical baseline/delta above describes the earlier repair session,
not the 2026-10-15 run.

The single warning is environmental (joblib cannot count physical cores on this
Windows host) and is not an application defect.

## 3. New security tests in detail

| Test | Category | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| `test_weather_api_does_not_leak_internal_exception_text` | Security, negative | A `RuntimeError` containing a filesystem path is **not** echoed to the client; a generic message is returned and HTTP 400 is preserved |
| `test_weather_api_still_surfaces_weather_error_wording` | Regression guard | `WeatherError` messages remain user-visible, so the fix did not over-redact legitimate validation text |
| `test_reverse_geocode_api_does_not_leak_internal_exception_text` | Security, negative | A connection exception containing an internal hostname is not echoed; returns 502 with a generic message |
| `test_reverse_geocode_api_rejects_out_of_bounds_coordinates` | Boundary | Latitude 91 is rejected with 400 and the documented message |
| `test_api_endpoints_require_authentication` | Authorization | All three JSON APIs redirect unauthenticated requests |
| `test_second_user_cannot_mutate_first_user_activity` | Cross-user isolation | A second authenticated user's POST leaves the owner's activity row `PENDING` |
| `test_intruder_dashboard_does_not_expose_other_farm_name` | Cross-user isolation | Another farmer's farm name never appears in the intruder's dashboard HTML |
| `test_password_change_invalidates_existing_sessions` | Session state | After a password change the old session is rejected and the new password works |
| `test_tampered_auth_token_is_rejected` | Session security | A forged `auth_token` in the cookie does not grant access |
| `test_protected_pages_do_not_render_tracebacks` | Error handling | An internal exception in the crop path yields 503 with no traceback and no internal path |
| `test_csrf_token_is_required_for_state_changing_posts` | CSRF | With `CSRF_ENABLED=True` a wrong token is rejected (400) and the forged record is never written, while the valid token succeeds |

## 4. Categories with no coverage yet

| Category | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage measurement | NOT RUN | `coverage.py` is not installed in the environment |
| Accessibility automated audit | NOT RUN | No axe/Lighthouse integration present; accessibility changes are manual and reviewed by inspection only |
| Performance benchmarks | NOT RUN | No load-testing tool present. No latency numbers are claimed anywhere in this repository |
| Market live integration | BLOCKED | No successful live HTTP response has ever been observed |
| Farmer user study | NOT STARTED | Requires participants and ethics approval |

## 5. Browser automation (historical evidence)

`scripts/browser_check.py` drives headless Microsoft Edge via Playwright against
a disposable SQLite database on port 5056. It registers a synthetic account,
performs manual farm setup, exercises the crop planner, lifecycle, activities,
report problem, password change and session behaviour, then measures responsive
layout at 1366 px, 768 px and 390 px. It records JavaScript errors, failed
requests and HTTP errors into `artifacts/browser_results.json`.

The script creates its explicit test app against a temporary database.
However, it imports `app` before that app factory call, and the module-level
`app = create_app()` invokes initialization against the configured default
database. Therefore the old claim that the script never touches the farmer
database is not established; the current audit did not rerun the browser
script. Isolate the configured data path before importing `app` before any
future run.

The earlier browser run is recorded in `docs/research/experimental_results.md`.
It predates the latest homepage redesign and is not current evidence for the
present working tree.

## 6. Determinism notes

- Most test-created app instances use `tmp_path` SQLite databases; module
  import-time initialization can still use the configured default path.
- External services are mocked with `monkeypatch`; no automated test calls
  Open-Meteo, Nominatim, BigDataCloud or data.gov.in.
- One incidental live Open-Meteo call was observed during a manual debugging
  step and is recorded as such in `docs/research/experimental_results.md`. It is
  not part of any test.
- No real credential appears in any test. All accounts are synthetic.
