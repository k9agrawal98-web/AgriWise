# AgriWise AI

AgriWise AI is an intelligent crop lifecycle decision-support system designed for sustainable agriculture. The project combines machine learning for crop recommendation with a rule-based expert system for weather, irrigation, fertilizer, and crop-stage advice. It is built as a simple Flask application using SQLite and an easy-to-understand university-friendly architecture.

## Problem Statement

Farmers often require guidance from crop selection to harvesting, but most systems focus only on one decision area at a time. This project brings together crop recommendation, weather analysis, crop-stage planning, and expert agricultural advice in a single decision-support system.

## Features

- AI-based crop recommendation using a simple machine learning model
- Browser geolocation for farm location detection
- Weather fetch and analysis through the Open-Meteo API
- Crop lifecycle tracking and stage analysis
- Expert system with IF-THEN agricultural rules
- Farmer dashboard with advisory history
- SQLite-backed persistence for users, farms, and records
- Explainable AI outputs that show why a crop was recommended
- Educational agricultural disclaimers and safe decision-support language
- Private Problem Reports with farmer-entered symptoms and reference photos

## Architecture

The application follows a simple layered architecture:

- Browser / Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- Flask Backend: request handling, sessions, validation
- Database: SQLite for users, farms, recommendations, weather, advisories
- ML Layer: trained crop classifier using scikit-learn
- Expert System: rule-based advisory engine for weather and crop management
- Weather Layer: Open-Meteo API integration
- Lifecycle Layer: crop growth stage and harvesting guidance

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Flask
- SQLite
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- requests
- Bootstrap
- Chart.js (optional if used in UI)

## Installation

1. Open a terminal in the project root.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv
3. Activate the environment:
   - Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset Placement

The crop recommendation model uses the original dataset at:

`data/Crop_recommendation.csv`

The local dataset has 2,200 rows and 22 balanced classes. Its original collection provenance, units, and license are unverified; local benchmark metrics are not evidence of nationwide field accuracy. See docs/data_provenance.md and the [crop recommendation reliability audit](docs/crop_recommendation_improvement.md).

For the end-to-end AI/decision-logic implementation, dataset inventory, training steps, and limitations, see [the AI implementation report](docs/ai_implementation_report.md).

## Model Training

Run:

python ml/train_model.py

This script holds out 20% of data before selection, compares classifiers using five-fold macro-F1 CV on training data only, evaluates the selected model once on the untouched holdout, and refits it on all rows for serving. It saves the model to `ml/crop_model.pkl`, holdout metrics and data metadata to `ml/model_metrics.json`, and the holdout confusion matrix to `ml/confusion_matrix.png`. It does not expand or modify the source CSV. Reproduction details and limitations are in `docs/crop_recommendation_improvement.md`.

## Database Initialization

The database is created automatically when the app starts. SQLite database file:

`database.db`

If it does not exist, the app creates the required tables on startup.

## Running the Application

Start the app:

python app.py

Then open:

http://localhost:5000

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

pytest

This covers authentication, weather parsing, ML behavior, expert rules, lifecycle calculations, and route flow.

## Folder Structure

- `app.py` — main Flask app
- `database.db` — SQLite database
- `requirements.txt` — project dependencies
- `data/Crop_recommendation.csv` — crop classification dataset
- `ml/train_model.py` — training script
- `ml/crop_model.pkl` — trained model
- `ml/model_metrics.json` — training metrics
- `services/` — weather, lifecycle, crop, explanation, and expert services
- `templates/` — Flask HTML templates
- `static/` — CSS and JavaScript
- `tests/` — automated tests

## ML Workflow

1. Load crop dataset
2. Check required feature columns
3. Reserve a stratified 20% final holdout with `random_state=42`
4. Compare fixed/tuned Random Forest, Extra Trees, scaled KNN, and Histogram Gradient Boosting
5. Select by five-fold training-only CV macro F1; evaluate the final holdout once
6. Refit the selected configuration on all available training observations for serving
7. Use the model for crop prediction in the app

## Expert System Workflow

The expert system analyzes:

- crop stage
- current weather
- soil conditions
- nutrient values
- rainfall and wind trends
- forecast information

It generates recommendations such as irrigation timing, fertilizer planning, disease-risk alerts, and harvest warnings based on IF-THEN rules.

## Weather Workflow

1. Read farm latitude and longitude
2. Call the Open-Meteo API
3. Parse current and future forecast values
4. Store weather information in SQLite
5. Use the weather output in the dashboard and expert system analysis

## Future Scope

- Add a stronger crop yield prediction module
- Add personalized irrigation schedules based on soil moisture sensors
- Add seasonal recommendations and local agronomic knowledge
- Expand lifecycle profiles for more crops
- Add admin views and analytics dashboards

## Disclaimer

AgriWise AI provides decision-support recommendations for educational and planning purposes. Local soil tests, agricultural experts, and official agronomic guidance should be considered before major farming decisions.


## Existing-project repair audit (2026-09-30)

See [requirements audit](docs/requirements_audit.md), [engineering report](docs/engineering_report.md), [API status](docs/api_integrations.md), and [model card](docs/model_cards.md). The master specification is not fully implemented; the audit identifies incomplete workflows separately from unavailable external data.

Local configuration is loaded from ignored `.env`. Set `AGRIWISE_SECRET_KEY` and `DATA_GOV_IN_API_KEY` there, or use environment variables. Never commit credentials. Market access is nonblocking: one background refresh, three bounded retries (0.5/1 second delays), five-minute failure cooldown, 30-minute successful query cache, and five-second spacing for new filter requests. Disk cache retains official source and original fetch timestamp. Status is fresh (<60 seconds), cached (<=30 minutes), stale (>30 minutes), or unavailable. The lock is per application process; multi-worker deployment would need shared locking.

```powershell
python scripts/diagnose_market_api.py
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/browser_check.py
```

The standalone diagnostic prints stages and exception types without credentials. Browser verification requires Playwright and Microsoft Edge. Earlier data.gov.in diagnostics conflict on whether the connection reached TLS; neither established an HTTP response or usable price records. Do not treat either as current status; see [API integration notes](docs/api_integrations.md). Offline weather, generated market/vendor fixtures, fabricated disease probabilities, and unsupported profit estimates are not used as live evidence.


## Historical status and verification (2026-10-14)

The earlier task tracker **[CLINE_PROGRESS.md](CLINE_PROGRESS.md)** recorded
what is IMPLEMENTED, TESTED, VERIFIED and BLOCKED, with the evidence for each.

Results recorded for that earlier snapshot:

- Full automated suite: **145 passed, 0 failed** (`python -m pytest -q`).
- Security regression suite `tests/test_security.py`: **11 passed**.
- Browser automation `scripts/browser_check.py`: **exit code 0**, 19 page checks
  HTTP 200, 0 JavaScript errors, 0 HTTP errors, WebGL scene `ready`.
- Test inventory: [docs/test_inventory.md](docs/test_inventory.md).

These are historical results and do not verify the current homepage redesign.
The latest full test run is recorded below.

Two information-disclosure defects were fixed in the JSON APIs so internal
exception text is never returned to the client; both are covered by regression
tests. A stale selector in `scripts/browser_check.py` was also corrected.

### Research documentation

Research material lives in [docs/research/](docs/research):

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| `literature_review.md` | Two peer-reviewed papers, each fetched and read from the publisher or PMC, with verified title, authors, year, venue and DOI, plus author-stated vs inferred limitations |
| `research_gap_evidence.md` | Candidate gaps graded by whether the literature actually supports them |
| `dataset_provenance.md` | Dataset attributes, with provenance explicitly recorded as NOT ESTABLISHED |
| `methodology.md` | Reproducible evaluation protocol, seeds, metrics, software versions and threats to validity |
| `experimental_results.md` | Only results actually produced, plus an explicit list of experiments not run |
| `limitations_and_future_work.md` | Full limitation register and what must never be claimed |
| `research_paper_outline.md` | Section-by-section outline, marked **NOT publication-ready** |

The crop classifier's 0.9955 final random-holdout accuracy is a **local benchmark result**.
The training dataset's provider, licence, measurement units, collection geography and collection
period are not established, and no geographic or temporal holdout was performed.
The model comparison found no accuracy or macro-F1 gain over its fixed Random Forest baseline.
No Pune, Maharashtra or India-wide accuracy claim is made or should be inferred.
The standalone disease-image screener has been removed. Problem Report can save
symptoms and a private reference photo but does not analyze the image. There is
no email, SMS or push notification delivery.

## Audit update (2026-10-16)

The full automated test suite was run with
`.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q --no-header -p no:cacheprovider`:
**164 passed, 1 warning, 0 failed**. The warning is joblib's
Windows physical-core discovery fallback. Importing `app.py` also initializes
the configured default database; during this run that path resolved to
`database.db`. Its contents were not inspected and pre-run file metadata was
not captured, so whether the test run changed existing schema/data is
unknown. See [the research audit](docs/research_audit/README.md) before
rerunning tests against the default data directory.
